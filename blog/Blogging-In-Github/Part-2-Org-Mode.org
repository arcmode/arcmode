* Org mode is great

I am trying to get more involved with this project. I want to start adding posts more often
so I can exercise my writing skills and motivate myself to try new things and share more.

The initial setup for this blog was based on Markdown. Thanks to Pandoc, today I am working on
adding Org mode as an option for wriging posts too. 

Some of the things I like the most about Org mode

** Emacs support
** Pandoc compatible
** Multi-purpose: documentation, literate coding, blogging, writing, etc...

That's it. I don't know if I will use Org mode or Markdown more but having both available is cool
and working with Org mode is always somethig I find to be fun.
